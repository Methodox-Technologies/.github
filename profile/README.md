# Parcel - The Workflow Engine (Organization Overview Page)

Hi there!👋

Parcel is an advanced lightweight general-purpose functional/procedural node based visual scripting platform/workflow execution engine, along with PSL (Parcel Standard Libraries), POF (Parcel Original Frameworks), PVM (Parcel Virtual Machine) and POS (Parcel Open Stadards) specs, with built-in runtime handling and context awareness for C# and Python, and a text-based scripting DSL (Domain-Specific Language) known as MiniParcel. Here is a video demo of an [early prototype in C# implemented using WPF (2022)](https://youtu.be/yEHaf_4y5AE). It's simple enough to be used by non-programmers but also extensive enough to be used by experienced developers. The primary focus of Parcel at know is shell automation and data analytics.

Parcel is specified by a [suite of standards](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Parcel/Parcel_NExT/tree/main/Parcel%20Open%20Standard) and is provided as a [reference implementation](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Parcel/Parcel_NExT/tree/main/C%23).

Parcel is a workflow-engine designed to make office life and data analytics easier with better visualization, and with a stretch - maybe even fun! It's direct "competitors" are Microsoft Excel, MathWorks MATLAB, and Python - though different tools are designed for different things. Parcel is designed for non-programmers, but it's also intended to be as extensible as possible 😆 My intention is to create a new kind of data analytics role which I shall call "Technical Analyst", which is like in between a usual data analyst and someone who is also concerned with higher-level insights (like manager). It's a bridge between lower level implementations (e.g. in Python or C#) and higher level analytics goals.

* Inspired by Houdini and Grasshooper, as a replacement to Excel, Ipython, and Matlab - it's a graphical platform designed for interactively designing, debugging and executing workflow-based processes, enabling efficient iterations of data operations; 
* Currently working on second iteration, with full Python interoperability (through Cpython)

The key problem Parcel trying to solve is the "growth" problem of prototype analytical scripts - you will know what I mean if you've started something simple in Python, and a few months later is becomes a monster that you don't want to touch. Beginners and new programmers in Python are especially prone to this problem, because they thought Python is easy to learn, only to learn that it's not that easy to write good Python good after all.
